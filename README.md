# Advanced Robotic Localization Techniques: Comparative Analysis of Kalman and Particle Filters
This repository presents a comprehensive study on advanced localization techniques in robotics, utilizing the PR2 robot within a PyBullet simulation environment. The core objective is to implement and analyze the performance of two prominent localization methods: the Kalman filter and the particle filter. These methods are applied to estimate the robot's position as it navigates through a path interspersed with obstacles.

The project involves the development of a simulated location sensor in PyBullet, which provides an estimate of the robotâ€™s position with an intentional inclusion of noise. This aspect of the simulation is critical, as it mirrors real-world uncertainties in robotic navigation. The challenge lies in adjusting the noise in both sensing and action, along with fine-tuning the parameters of the Kalman and particle filters. The aim is to maintain a realistic yet computationally manageable level of complexity.

A unique aspect of this study is the comparative analysis of the Kalman and particle filters under various scenarios. This analysis not only includes their accuracy but also their robustness in challenging situations. A specific focus is placed on a scenario where the Kalman filter fails to yield a reasonable estimate, such as when the calculated mean falls within an obstacle, while the particle filter succeeds in providing a viable solution.

Included in this repository are detailed descriptions of the motion and sensor models employed, alongside the noise covariance parameters. This documentation is intended to provide clarity and insight into the methodology and rationale behind the algorithmic choices. This project serves as a valuable resource for researchers, academics, and practitioners in the field of robotics and autonomous systems, offering a detailed exploration of two pivotal localization techniques and their practical applications
