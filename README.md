#header H1 Advanced Robotic Localization Project
About:
This project focuses on advanced localization techniques in robotics, leveraging the PR2 robot in a PyBullet simulation environment. It implements and evaluates two prominent localization algorithms: the Kalman Filter (KF) and the Particle Filter (PF). These algorithms are used to estimate the robot's position as it navigates through a complex path with obstacles. The project stands out in its comparative analysis of KF and PF under various scenarios, including cases where the KF may struggle while the PF excels. The next phase of the project will involve using these algorithms to guide the PR2 robot's movement in the PyBullet environment. 

Project Status
Current Phase: Development and evaluation of KF and PF algorithms.
Next Steps: Implementing the robot's movement in PyBullet using trajectories generated by the KF and PF.

FAQ Section
Q: What are the key differences between KF and PF in this project?
A: KF is best for scenarios with Gaussian noise, while PF excels in non-linear, non-Gaussian environments.
Q: Can I contribute to the project?
A: Yes, contributions are welcome! Please see the 'Desired Collaboration' section.
Q: How can I adjust the noise levels in the simulation?
A: Noise levels can be adjusted in the respective filter classes in the code.
